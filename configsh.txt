# Creating a systemd Service File

To create a systemd service file for your Python application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to edit the service file using nano:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/app_script.service
    ```

2. Add the following content to the file:

    ```makefile
    [Unit]
    Description=Start My Python Application
    
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/seb/dev/frontendartVLCplayer/start_app.sh
    WorkingDirectory=/home/seb/dev/frontendartVLCplayer
    Restart=always
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

3. Save and exit the editor.

4. Enable the service using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable app_script.service
    ```

5. Optionally, start the service using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start app_script.service
    ```

6. Verify the status of the service to ensure it's active and running:

    ```lua
    sudo systemctl status app_script.service
    ```

    This should show that the service is active and running.

7. Optionally, you can reboot your system to ensure that the service starts automatically at boot time:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

8. After rebooting, verify that the service is still active and running:

    ```lua
    sudo systemctl status app_script.service
    ```
